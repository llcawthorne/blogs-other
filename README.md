# blogs-other #

This is just a place for me to keep sample code from blogposts that I follow along with. I've separated Java blogposts into three categories. blogs-java, blogs-jee, and blogs-spring. I've also made a blogs-clojure repo for when I follow along with clojure blogs, and I've added a blogs-scala too. I'm still unsure about kotlin outside new gradle buildscripts with IDE support (which sound awesome), but I'll create a blogs-kotlin too.  I read blogs on a lot of different topics, but I haven't been saving all my work. Hopefully with the projects in one place, I'll have a reliable way to refresh my memory about something I read once.

I've been doing one repo per course when following along with courses, but this is simply unsustainable with blogposts, since there are so many.

This is my blogs-other category, for when I want to keep code exercises from
blogposts that I follow along with that don't fit into one of the other
categories.  So far, I have categories for the main topics that I tend 
to interact with: Angular, Clojure, Gradle Projects, JavaScript,
Maven Projects, and Scala.  Other things fit in here.  You might see
the occasional work through of something in C, or using Powershell to
do something, or maybe a Docker tutorial, or the occasional Python 
project.
